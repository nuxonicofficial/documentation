# Quick Start

## Get your API keys

Your API requests are authenticated using API keys. Any request that doesn't include an API key will return an error.

You can generate an API key from your[ Dashboard](https://nuxonic.com) at any time.

## Install the library

The best way to interact with our API is to use one of our official libraries:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Node" %}
```
# Install via NPM
npm install --save nuxonic
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Good to know:** You can see sample codes by selecting different languages.
